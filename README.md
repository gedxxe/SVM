# SVM
This repository includes the needed resources for the "BIG DATA AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (2023205162) / (301)" course.

In this session, I'll practice the Support Vector Machine Classifier concept for the predicting "Pulsar Star - Pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey" based on given dataset obtained from Kaggle.

# Notes
- This rep is still under development and in the experimental stage.
- Future improvements will be made to satisfy the SVM practice results.
